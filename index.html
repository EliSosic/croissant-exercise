    <h1> Croissant 🥐</h1>

    <h4> A croissant is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent shape.</h4>

    <p>
        It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.
        Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
